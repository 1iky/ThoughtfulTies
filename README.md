# ThoughtfulTies 😊 - A social networking app
## Project Info 💡
Thoughtful Ties is a React Native-based mobile app, where friendships are woven with care. To create long-lasting, quality friendships within the elderly community, this app aims to introduce a clean and easy-to-navigate design. Our team wishes to provide a solution for the elderly community who feel like they are being left behind in an age of rapidly advancing technology, and for those who are struggling in our society's loneliness epidemic.
